# Artist Statement



Originally, I planned to create a gentle gradient frame for my name tag.However, I was enable to realize the color transition naturally. So, when I looked up the reference from the site, I happened to find that the function 'creatIamge' had one sample that fit my expectation. Therefore, I used this piece of code for reference. 

To make my name tag looks less dull, I adjusted the gradient square to small color blocks, connecting each of them in similar order, which displayed a background of mosaic. Besides , I added several grey squares to increase the depth of the background. The thick stroke weight was set to highlight the words.

I'd like to make my tag look simple but not dull, so I picked soft colors: cyan and pale pink, which has contrast hue as well, setting a distinct boundary of the backgroud and the text. The color also made this tag seemed more lively.
